# 5-DOF Robotic Arm – Tinkercad model

## Overview
This task involves the 3D modeling of a **5 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) robotic arm** using Tinkercad. The purpose is to visualize the mechanical design and joint structure of a simplified robotic manipulator.
##  Degrees of Freedom Explained
1. **Base rotation** – Horizontal swivel (Yaw)
2. **Shoulder joint** – Vertical lift (Pitch)
3. **Elbow joint** – Mid-arm bend (Pitch)
4. **Wrist pitch** – Vertical tilt
5. **Wrist roll** – Rotational twist

##  Design Notes
- Joints are visually represented using spheres; actual kinematic simulation is **not supported in Tinkercad**
- Grouping is used to simulate combined movement
- No real servo constraints or actuators are modeled
